ABOUT THE JWILDFIRE APPLET
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The JWildfireApplet introduced with version 1.04 is just for playing around and has only two functions:
 - create random fractals and display them on the screen using a progressive display
 - export the parameters of the currently displayed fractal (if you like it) to the clipboard for further processing in the full application
 
Have fun!

HOW TO LAUCH 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To launch the applet just double-click at the j-wildfire-applet.jar. There is no separate launcher required, and there are no paramaters.

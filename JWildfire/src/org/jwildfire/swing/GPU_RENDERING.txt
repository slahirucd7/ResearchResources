1. Introducing FAEngine and FACLRender

GPU rendering in JWildfire is enabled by integrating FAEngine, an GPU-rendering-engine, 
created by Steven Brodhead.
Steven is the author of Fractal Architect, a flame-fractal-software for the Mac OS-platform, 
and has decided to make his GPU-render-capable engine open source, and also port it to 
the Windows-platform.

FACLRender is a command-line-tool to invoke the engine and render a flame. It is the current
way to integrate this engine into JWildfire. While this has some drawbacks in terms of
performance, it has advantages in terms of stability and maintainability. For example,
the GPU-render can never crash your current JWildfire session and we can update the 
engine independently from the main program.    

1.1 Limitations
Currently, the engine is limited in terms of features (e.g. supported variations) and
supported frameworks, but it actually works. And, it works very well. 

Steven and I are collaborating in order to improve the integration into JWildfire and add
more features to it.

For now, it only supports the Windows-plattform, uses OpenCl and has a very limited
set of features (in comparison to the full JWildfire application, e. g. 3D-rendering
is completely missed). 

1.2 Further improvements
You may expect an continous improvement in terms of added features, but this progress 
will not be very fast. This is because, parallel computing can be rather complicated
and is not easy to debug. E.g., a simple change can break overall performance easily,
but it can be very difficult to find out which change was responsible. 
  
1.3 Requirements
You will need a modern graphics card with plenty of memory to make out the most of this 
stuff. I'm using a GeForce GFX 980 with 4 GB of video memory, which works very well,
but probably similar AMD-devices will work nicely, too. Only 64Bit is supported at all.

2. Installation
FACLRender comes as a separate package, you must download separately. This enables us to
update it more often than the main JWildfire application, if required.

The overall installation is simple:
1. Download the recent FACLRender-package from http://www.andreas-maschke.com/ 
2. Extract the download *.zip-file to some permanent path on you hard-disk, preferably
not on the Desktop, e. g. on D:\Program Files\FACLRender. 
If you look into this folder, you should see a file FACLRender.exe
3. Start JWildfire and open the Preferences-window. Locate the property named 
tinaFACLRenderPath and enter the path to folder which contains the FACLRender.exe.
In this example, enter "D:\Program Files\FACLRender"
4. Press the "Save and Close"-button and exit JWildfire
5. Start JWildfire again, now you should see a new entry "Fractal flames: GPU render"
in the main Window-menu (see section 3.).

2.1 Self-Test
To test the GPU-rendering itself (and to simplify further troubleshooting), please invoke
the self-test. Just enter the directory where you installed FACLRender and open the sub-folder
"selftest" ( In this example "D:\Program Files\FACLRender\selftest" ).
Double click at the selftest.bat. If everything works as expected, you should see that 
"selftest.png" was created. Otherwise, the console output hopefully helps to solve the
problem.

3. Rendering flames using the GPU
Use the "GPU renderer"-window to play with flames. This window works similar to the 
Interactive renderer, you may import flames from the editor or load them from harddisc etc.

Most flames will not work flawless, as most flames have at least one feature which is not
supported by GPU-rendering at this time. But, of course, you will be able to create endless
beautiful flames, though. 

3.1 Using the "Linear Only"-random-flame-generator 
A good starting point is to use the "Linear Only"-random-flame-generator to create a batch
of flames which are guaranteed to work. Pick some nice one, transfer it to the GPU-render
and see how it performs. Add some feature, see if it is still supported by GPU, etc.

3.2 Batch rendering
When FACLRender is propertly integrated into JWildfire there appears a new "GPU"-button 
in the Batch-renderer. You may use it to render whole batches by using the GPU.
But, before you render a huge sequence, you should be sure that the flames do not use
features which are not supported by FACLRender. You may quickly do so by transfering 
one of the flames to the "GPU renderer"-window and see if it works.

4. Troubleshooting
If rendering fails, you should check if the FACLRender.exe can detect any devices (or is 
missung some vital library, for example). To do so, open a console/terminal window
and enter the directory where the FACLRender.exe resides.
Enter the command: 
  FACLRender
If the programm can be started at all, it should output a list of options, one of then
being "-list"

So, enter the command:
  FACLRender -list
to get a list of detected devices. When something is wrong, you hopefully will get some 
usefull information displayed here.

4.1 Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
If some *.dlls are missing, installing the the
  "Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015"-Kit
from Microsoft will help in the most cases.

4.2 OpenCl drivers
Also, be sure to have OpenCl-drivers for your graphics card installed.

<h1>1 Welcome!</h1>
<p>This sub-module will enable you to create 3d-models you can use in any available 
  3d-package to create real 3d-images with refraction-effects, shadows and whatever 
  you want. You could even create solid objects to put onto your (real! :-)) desk 
  using a 3d-printing-service! </p>
<p>But, you will need a lot of patience and a modern computer with at least 8 GB of RAM, otherwise it may also work, but will probably not be much fun. </p>  
<p>You may copy this text and paste it into an editor like Wordpad for easier 
  reading (&lt;Strg+A&gt; to select all, &lt;Strg+C&gt; to copy it, and then use 
  &quot;Paste&quot; in your editor). </p>
<h1>2 How does it work?</h1>
The basic idea is the one of a CT scan. You scan an object slice by slice to obtain a model of the whole. 
The make it work, the object (i. e. the fractal) must to be a (pseudo-)3d-fractal. A "slice" is just a 2D-render of this object at a certain "scan-position" (z-coordinate).
So, there are five steps involved:
<ul>
<li>Design the fractal
<li>Render the slices ("perform the CT scan")
<li>Create a model from those slices
<li>clean-up, smooth, refine, ... the model
<li>render the model in any 3d-software
</ul>

<h1>3 What do we need?</h1>
You will need a lot of passion, some decent computer hardware and a few software packages for various tasks. But you do not need any expensive commercial software, 
anything can be done using fine free software. All of this will be explained in the following sections in detail.

<h2>3.1 "Solid" flame fractals</h2>
What helps the most is the ability to create "solid" (i. e. not too noisy) flame-fractals, in 3d. But there are many tutorials around which help you. 
Good candidates to start are the so-called "3D Bubbles", "3D Julian Bubbles" or "Xenophilia".

<h2>3.2 The JWildfire volumetric renderer</h2>
The JWildfire volumetric renderer is a specialized version of the default renderer and is capable to render a number of images (=slices) in parallel, 
in order to save time. It is also multi-threaded and can use the whole power of your machine. 
The parallel computation comes at the cost of higher memory consumption. You can adjust how many slices you want to generate in one step. 
Imagine that all slices would fit into memory, then you could generate all slices in the same time you would just render one regular image :-) 
   
<h2>3.3 The JWildfire Mesh-generator</h2>
The built-in mesh-generator uses the marching-cubes algorithm to create a mesh from the previously rendered slices. The mesh-generator is also multi-threaded and this way comes with very decent speed. 
Please note, that it is absolutely intended that slice-rendering and mesh-generation are two distinct steps. This is because you could create different meshes 
from the same set of slices by chosing different options like threshold, but generating the slices is rather expensive.
 
<h2>3.4 The free MeshLab-software</h2>
The free MeshLab-software is used to clean-up, smooth, reduce, ... your model. 
You can download it from <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/</a> 

<h2>3.5 Any 3D-package</h2>
Use any 3D-Renderer you want, to finally render the model created in *.obj-format. If you have no idea, where to start: both Blender ( <a href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">http://www.blender.org/</a> )
and Bryce ( <a href="http://www.daz3d.com/software/bryce" target="_top">http://www.daz3d.com/software/bryce</a>) are excellent choices, the latter is not exactly free, but cost only about 20$. 

<h1>4 Let's create the first model!</h1>
<h2>4.1 Inside JWildfire</h2>
<ul>
<li>Load a previously designed "solid" flame-fractal, if you have no idea were to start, just try the example from the Appendix of this document (you may freely use and alter this for aynthing you want) 
<li>Select the right "top-view"-position using the "CentreX", "CentreY" and "Zoom"-sliders. This the size of each "scan"
<li>Select slicing area (range of the "scan") using the "Position 1" and "Position 2" sliders. To help you with this those positions are visualized inside the fractal-preview 
<li>Select the volumetric-resolution, quality and memory-consumption
<ul>
<li>"Render width" and "Render height" specifies the resolutiuon of each slice
<li>"Total number of slices" specifies the number of slices and together with the slicing range ("Position 1" and "Postion 2") the cutting range
<li>"Slices per pass" is a major speed-up option. It allows to generate any number of slices in parallel, at nearly no CPU-cost, but, ... each slice must fit into memory.
So, the higher this value, the faster the render, but the more memory is needed.
<li>"Render quality" is the quality for generating slices. If you have a noisy fractal, you may need higher values. As a general rule of thumb use a quality level in the range equal or down to the half of the slice size.
<li>Wait until the rendering process is finished (should only take a about some minutes) and enter the "Mesh generation"-tab
<li>Chose your recently created slices by hitting the "From renderer"-button. If you later come back after shutting down JWildfire you can also select them from the folder you saved them to by using the "Load sequence" button
<li>Choose an appropriate image-downsampling value. Image-downsampling reduces the resolution of the model (i. e. reduces both size and detail-level) and makes it more smooth. You will chose values in the range of 1 ... 3 in the most cases
<li>Choose an appropriate filter radius for smoothing the model. Beware that this filtering can slow down the mesh-generation a lot, while it has only a rather local impact. Typical values are in the range of 0 ... 0.4
<li>Choose an appropriate brightness-threshold. This is the most important setting and affects at which brightness level algorithm starts to "see" the model. 
The default value of 0 means that every detail of a slice which is not exactly black will find its way into the model. 
Maybe it will later be filtered out by the spatial filter, but still it has a little influence. If you increase the threshold only brighter portions of the slices will be
"seen" by the mesh-generator. So increasing this threshold especially helps to filter out dark background noise. But beyond this, you can get some really interesting effect
 by just playing with this setting around.            
<li>Sometimes you may have created too many slices, for example if you used the default volumetric resolution of 512x512x512 and have a very flat object. In this case you can use the image-step-option 
to skip generated slices for mesh-generation. This option defaults to 1 which means that every slice is taken into account. If you increase ot to 2, only every 2nd slice is taken etc.
<li>If your slices are very noisy or contain very thin details, you can apply upto two pre-filters to it. You can choose between different filters to reduce noise and increase the thickness of image details. 
Just play around with different options and generate different models for later comparison to choose the best.      

<li>Click the "Generate"-button and choose a filename for your Mesh. Currently, the meshes are saved in Wavefront *.obj-format, because it is very easy to create files in this format, 
and it can be read by almost any 3d-package around. Maybe later I will add more formats.
<li>Note that you can cancel both slice-rendering and mesh-generation
<li>If you have enabled the "Auto preview"-checkbox, JWildfire will automaticall render a preview-image after creating the mesh. This may take some seconds if you create a really huge mesh.
<li>You can manipulate the preview by altering zoom, position and rotation. If the mesh is too large to be displayed quick, JWildfire automatically creares a reduced model 
which is displayed while you modify the view. To view the complete model again, press the "Refresh Preview"-button    
</ul>    
</ul>

<h2>4.3 Inside MeshLab</h2>
<ul>
<li>start the MeshLab-software
<ul>
<li> for example "meshlab.exe" in the installation drawer "MeshLab" on Windows
</ul>
<li>open the generated mesh
<ul>
<li>choose the menu item "File"->"Import Mesh"
</ul> 
<li>turn the orientation of faces into the right direction
<ul>
<li>choose the menu item "Filters"->"Normals, Curvature and Orientation"->"Invert Faces Orientation"
<li>in the next window click "Apply" and the "Close"
</ul>
<li>eventually smooth the mesh
<ul>
<li>for example "Filters"->"Smoothing, Fairing and Deformation"->"Taubin Smooth"
</ul>
<li>eventually recreate the mesh with lower polygon count
<ul>
<li>for example "Filters->"Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction"->"Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation" (enter any desired "Target number of faces" value)
</ul>
<li>there are endless options to play around :-)
<li>finally, save the altered mesh "File"->"Export Mesh As..."
</ul>
<h2>4.4 Have fun to use the model in your 3d-package</h2>

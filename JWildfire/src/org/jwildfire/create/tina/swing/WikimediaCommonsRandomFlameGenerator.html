<h2>Beware! This random-flame-generator is different from all others!</h2>
<ul>
<li>It connects to the internet to download random images from the Wikipedia Commons!
<li>It may use a lot of memory!
<li>You must handle copyright issues with care!
<li>It may be slow!
<li>But: It is cool! :-)
</ul>
 
<h2>How it works, what exactly does it download</h2> 
<ul>
<li>It downloads random images (only *.jpg or *.png) from Wikimedia Commons
<li>Those images are stored together with the orginal url to an internal pool in memory
<li>The pool per session can hold 20 images at one time. 
<li>While you generate more random flames some images from the pool were exchanged by new downloaded images
<li>It uses some other certain random-flame-generators to construct a base-flame
<li>This base-flame is enhanced by the "post_colormap_wf"-variation which holds the image together with the original url
<li>JWildfire can not control the content of the images, but Wikipedia Common is known as serious ressource     
<li>This random-flame-generator is NOT included in the "All"-random-flame-generator and NOT executed automatically at startup
</ul> 
 
<h2>Dealing with Copyright issues</h2>
<li>
Some of the images at Wikimedia Commons are simple in terms of copyright issues, i. e. you must not deal about this at all, other images need more care.
But you have to deal with this problem in any case before you publish a flame generated by this generator. 
To help you with this JWildfire stores both the original image-url and the url of the page with the image-description. 
Just open your browser and point it to the URL's to see copyright terms (and some other informations) about the certain image used. 
<li>
To locate the url with the image-description just locate the "post_colormap_wf" variation in your fractal and select the property "image_desc_src". Click the detail-button and copy the url.  

Have fun!

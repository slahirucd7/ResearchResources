1. The randomizers at this tab are made in a way that you can execute them multiple times for the same flame in order to try
many possible options. I. e., there will be no "point of no return" that the flame is altered in a way, that further changes
will have no interesting change.<br><br>
2. You may also combine them, e.g. add bokeh or weighting-fields to a randomized flame<br><br>
3. To undo a lot of unwanted changes may be a tedious task. So it may make sense to start randomizing using a working
copy (by clicking at the SShot-button). So, you can keep your original flame unaltered and come back to it at any time.<br>

Samhain Splits - M Bourne Halloween 2018

A good collection of splits and some ornate patterns to use as computer wallpaper, for tweaking, for actual wallpaper (go on I dare you) 

Too tired to write out a full description for each of these, you'll see from the Transforms and variations, what's going on anyway. Even if you don't, just remember to play with the settings.

If you see dots you don't like on your images, that's the glynnsim1 variations. Delete these transforms from your flame to get rid. They repeat the outside to the centre, so your end result might have a hole in the middle if you remove them.

.

If you use these, it would be nice if you could let people know to find them on the JWildfire Sanctuary website and/or the JWildfire Sanctuary Facebook group. Just post a link to the website with your images will be enough. Please respect this so that others can have fun too.

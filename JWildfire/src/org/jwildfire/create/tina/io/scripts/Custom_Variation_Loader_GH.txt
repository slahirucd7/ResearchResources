You may download a collection of example variations in the official forum: http://jwildfire.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1957&p=4917#p4917 

creates a "custom_full_wf" variation
   and populates it with custom variation code 
   selected by user from a list of possible custom variations
   in the "custom_variations" subfolder

   to add additional custom variations to the list,
         copy them to subfolder "custom_variations"
         in same folder as this script

   uses CustomFullVariationWrapperFunc ("custom_wf_full")
         for dynamic loading of custom variation code
   uses script user interface API
         to show options
   uses script persistence API
         to remember previously selected options

   options:
       custom code: which custom variation to load
             (from those found in "custom_variations" subfolder)
       final: use a normal transform or a final transform
       undo on repeat runs: if repeatedly running from the same
                dialog, revert any previous changes made from
                the dialog before running again
       transform: whether to add new variation to a new transform
                or add to existing transform
                possible values: 
                     "new": create new transform to add variation to
                     "random": randomly select existing transform to use
                     number N: add to transform N (or add to new 
                           transform if transform N doesn't exist)
       vindex: position in transform's variation list
                at which to insert new variation
                Possible values: 
                     "first":  insert variation at beginning of variation list
                     "last":   insert variation at end of variation list
                     "random": insert variation at random position
                     number N: insert variation at position N, 
                            or at end of list if N > size of list
       randomize params:
              randomizes all params for the variation,
              in the range -2 to +2

Lumiere Scripts by Michael Bourne 2019 

Some fun to be had with light that's for sure. Loved the way the glows and the beams were occurring in these, and wanted to experiment further with different layouts and styles. There's a fair bit you can tweak with these, you probably want to try changing the final transform to begin with. After that, it's entirely up to you.

I'd like to thank Mi Mi, for the gist of this construct and for her great friendship, we'll get back to doing another team set of scripts soon, I'm sure.

I'd also like to thank everyone at the JWildfire Sanctuary Facebook group, the artwork there is just mind bogglingly good!

Obviously I'd like to thank Andreas Maschke for creating this software, and continuing with help from Rick Sidwell, Jesus Sosa, Brad Stefanov and Whittaker Courtney.

Don't forget, if you use these scripts and post images for them, include a link back to their download page at the JWildfire Sanctuary website!!! (don't know how many times I ask this, and people just put the name of the script). Imagine it's a year down the line and all you have is a name. Much easier if there's a link to where you can get the download, than asking around etc. Please try to stick to this, it's only fair.

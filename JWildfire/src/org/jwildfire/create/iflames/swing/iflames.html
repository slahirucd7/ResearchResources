<h1>Welcome to the iflames-editor!</h1>
<h2>Getting started: create a library</h2>
Even if it is not truly necessary, it is highly recommended, to create a library. 
It makes it a lot easier (and a lot of more fun) to just play around with iflames.<br><br>
A library is a collection of images and flames which can be used by double-clicking at them in the interface to compose iflames.<br><br>
Here is a short guide to create your initial library:
<ul>
<li>Create a new main directory for stuff related to iflames, e.g. "D:\Graphics\iflames"</li>
<li>Create a sub directory to hold images, e.g. "D:\Graphics\iflames\image-library"</li>
<li>Copy some of your favourite images (as *.PNG-files) into the image-drawer, 5-10 images is a good number to start</li>
<li>Create a sub directory to hold flames, e.g. "D:\Graphics\iflames\flame-library"</li>
<li>Copy some of your favourite flames (as *.FLAME-files) into the flame-drawer, 5-10 flames is a good number to start. 
Please note that not all flames will work well inside of iflames, and only flames with one layer are supported.
Additionally, most "special effects" like post-symmetry or bokeh-effects will be not be visible inside iflames.
Flames with simple and sharp structure work the best, e. g. a fractal flower.  
</li>
<li>Enter the Preferences-window and change the following settings:
<ul>
<li>Set <b>iflamesFlameLibraryPath</b> to the path of your image-library ("D:\Graphics\iflames\image-library" in the example)</li>
<li>Set <b>iflamesImageLibraryPath</b> to the path of your flame-library ("D:\Graphics\iflames\flame-library" in the example)</li>
<li>Check the option <b>iflamesLoadLibraryAtStartup</b> to automatically load the library at startup
</ul>
<li>Close JWildfire and open it again, loading the library for the first time may take some time (depends on the number of images and flames),
so please be patient. You now should see two columns of thumbnails showing your images and flames.
</ul> 

<h2>Create your first iflame using your library</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just hit the "New IFlame"-button. The program uses a random image from your library and some random flames from your libary to construct an iflame</li>
<li>To use another image just double-click at the thumbnail</li>
<li>If you want to use an external image, just load by pressing the "Add images"-button. Please note, that such images will not be added to library. To add images to the library you have to copy them to the library folder. </li>
<li>To exchange a flame just double-click at the thumbnail</li>
<li>If you want to use an external flame, just load by pressing the "Add flames"-button. Please note, that such flames will not be added to library. To add flames to the library you have to copy them to the library folder. </li>
<li>Switch between several base-flames using the "Base-Flame"-Listbox</li>
</ul>
 
 <h2>Use the main flame module to post-edit and render your iflames</h2>
After all, an iflame still remains a flame. So you can open it in the main editor like any other flame to adjust the render-settings,
camera, coloring, bokeh, ... as you would do with a regular flame.<br> 
You can also animate it and add motion-blur. And, you can render it using the interactive-renderer, of course. <br>
To change the default camera view inside the iflames-editor, you may export the iflame into the main editor, change view, 
and import it back into the iflames-editor.<br> 
Now, have fun!

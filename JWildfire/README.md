# JWildfire - an image and animation processor written in Java

## Introduction

JWildfire is the spiritual successor of the award winning special effect program Wildfire\7PPC for the Amiga â€“ 
but this time implemented in Java and with a more sophisticated user interface and more cool effects :-)

## Key Features
 - stunning 3D effects (such as wave3D, water, twirl3d, ...)
 - 3D effect superimposition (e. g. wave3D interference)
 - powerful Fractal flame generator
 - image generators (perlin noise, cloud generator, plasma, ...)
 - many "common" image processing effects in 2D (such as twirl, erode, convolve, ...)
 - simple but powerful user interface which allows it to animate nearly any parameter by just a few mouse clicks
 - Sunflow integration
